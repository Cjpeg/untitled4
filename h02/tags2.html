<h1>gojo satoru</h1>
<h3>who is gojo?</h3>
<p>Satoru Gojo is a tall man, towering over his students, and is apparently considered attractive by many women. He has white hair that's often spiked up, but Gojo lets it down when he's in more casual attire. Gojo has bright blue eyes, but they're usually covered by his signature black blindfold or a pair of dark sunglasses.

    While working, Gojo wears an all-black high-necked jacket with matching pants and dark dress boots. In the past, Gojo has worn bandages over his eyes rather than his simple blindfold. He has several different casual attires that usually include long-sleeved shirts and slacks. He even wears long-sleeved hoodies to the beach with black swim trunks.</p>

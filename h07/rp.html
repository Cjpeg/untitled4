        Yes, lawd
        Someone hit me the other day for a rendezvous
        "Long time no see" was the line she used
        Bright eyes like the lights at the carnival
        Held convos, but never held accountable
        How's your Mama Duke? How ya papa doin'?
        Oh, me? I been freer than the sample food
        But like a sample loop, around and 'round I move
        Until it's clear, then I'm back to baggin' bags of loot
        Spent years tryna steer both hands on you
        'Til I finally understood that I was spinnin' my hoop
        Rather spinnin' my wheels, gettin' up in my years
        But still I feel like a kid when I'm fuckin' with you
        Young nigga gotta live, that's the motto they use
        But all them niggas still live in they mama's backroom
        So I'm back in my stu', lookin' up at the stars
        When they reminisce over you, my God
